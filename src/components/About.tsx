                            Open Flow is a free, open-source communication tool designed to support people with speech or language challenges. Inspired by my own use of communication cards, and more specifically my tendency to lose them, this app serves as a digital set of communication cards. It allows users to not only use the cards provided, but generate their own custom cards and utilize text-to-speech to have the words or phrases spoken aloud.

                            communicate by providing ways to express themselves using symbols, text, or speech output. Open Flow enables your phone to become an AAC device.
